# Notable Changes
- Made Clickable Links Yellow
- Made Hover and Selected Items in the Table and Sidebar Blue
- Removed Custom Sidebar Icons to help make entire line clickable instead of only the text

### Updated to support qBittorrent v5+
**Hack to "fix" theme after qBittorrent WebUI stopped support for translation in v4.5. NOTE: Not optimised, just a splice of the current WebUI 5.0.2 (with translation strings removed) and the nightwalker styles**

# A Dark but not black qBittorrent WebUI 
**_A darker theme for qBittorrent WebUI_ (made with the help of the Walkerservers community)**

#### A note for those who used the [Theme Park][theme.park] nginx mod
Modify your nginx config and remove the lines that introduced the external css, anything after `rewrite ^/qbittorrent/(.*) /$1 break; ` (non inclusive) is something that can be removed. Do not leave -modded, or any other files that are not necessary for nginx to function in the `/etc/nginx/apps/` directory. Reload nginx after making changes by doing `sudo service nginx configtest`, if it returns OK, then proceed and do `sudo service nginx reload`.
